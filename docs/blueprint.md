## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A moderate cyan (#4AC0C0) for a sense of clarity, trust, and financial insight.
- Background color: A very light cyan (#E0F8F8), almost white, to provide a clean, uncluttered backdrop.
- Accent color: A muted blue-violet (#7A80D0), which is analogous to the primary cyan, and contrasting enough to bring attention to important interactive elements and calls to action.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font for a contemporary and technical feel.
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif font which complements 'Space Grotesk' well, providing a clean and readable text for the app's content. 
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons to represent data categories and actions.
- Implement a responsive design to ensure optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience (e.g., loading animations, data updates).
